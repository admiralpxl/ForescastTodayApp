# Forescast today App - Weather App

This project help me to practices how to manipulate the DOM, make AJAX template, and how to consult data from the OpenWeather API, using vanilla Javascript specifically using the fetch method to get the data and convert the information in a .json, using the catch method to manage the error can be present during the request.
